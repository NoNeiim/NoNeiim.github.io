# Private notes or public guides

So, this project was never my intention, i was actually out looking for a good note taking app to document my travels in the IT-djungle. 
After a couple of hours searching the web, i figured that maybe i could start a simple website/blog to host my notes instead. This way my notes would also be public and maybe, just maybe, could be of use to someone else aswell.

Said and done, i started this site using Jekyll and published it to the world using GitHub pages(this also became one of my first guides/notes).

With that said, hope you find my guides useful and if you are interested in sharing your notes to world aswell, checkout my guide on how to host a Jekyll site on Github pages.

Kind regards<br>
